# WELCOME TO MY HORSE BETTING SITE

## Installation

1. This file includes both back-end (HorseRace) and front-end (horserace-front) data.
2. To try out my application, first you'll need to run back-end using HorseRaceApplication.java
3. Under resources folder there is mock data that will build database automatically after HorseRaceApplication.java has been launched.
4. Once HorseRaceApplication.java is up and running, you can launch front-end.
5. I have used Vue.js and to run it, simply type int the terminal:

Project setup:
```bash
npm install
```
Compile:
```bash
npm run serve
```

## Description

The web application lets you create a new horse race (place, date and time), add horses to the corresponding race 
(3 horses minimum, no duplicate horses) and lets you bet on eligible races (min 3 horses and races that have no result 
yet). Additionally, you can look the results of completed races by using drop-down list selection.
